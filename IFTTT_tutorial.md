# The Onion + IFTTT Experience

![IFTTT](http://marketingland.com/wp-content/ml-loads/2012/09/ifttt-logo.jpg)

In this tutorial, we will show you how to do some very cool things using IFTTT, the Omega and the Onion Cloud. In particular, we will use the _DO_ App on Andriod by IFTTT to send the date 
and GPS information to be printed remotely on your Omega + OLED Screen. We will also give you a taste of the Onion Cloud and its capabilities. Let's get into it.

### What is IFTTT

[IFTTT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IFTTT) stands for "if this, then that", which is a web service that allows users to create some methods, which are called "recipes", that can set up user's own conditional statement (e.g. if I receive a new email on my gmail account, then forward it to another account). The conditional statement could be as simple as if a button is pressed, or as complex as you want. There is a "do" app in APPstore or Google Play store, which makes users able to trigger a event by pressing a button.

[//]: # (Theory && Introduction)

### Theory && Introduction

The theory of using IFTTT to control our Omega is, when one event is triggered, it sends a web request to Onion device server, which is interacting with device client (that is what we are going to install on Omega), and then it is going to trigger a ubus function, and the ubus function determines what you are going to do on the Omega. There are three ubus tutorials avaliable on Onion Wiki, click [here](https://wiki.onion.io/Tutorials/OpenWRT%20Tutorials/UBUS_Tutorial/Part1_Ubus_Intro) to create your own ubus function!

The recipes are created through "channels", which are different web services, for example, Gmail. Unfortunately, we haven't created our own channel yet (but it will be up very soon), so we are using IFTTT through a DIY channel, "Maker". Maker channel allows users to make a web request, however, there is no header option. Unfortunately again, to run a program on Omega, we have to send a API format web request to device server, that means, we need to create a local server to translate the request to another with headers. That would be perfect if you can write your own server, if not, don't worry, I created a test server for you! However, you still need a public server to run this local server on.
